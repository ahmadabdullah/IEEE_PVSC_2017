\begin_layout Abstract
With more solar photovoltaic (PV) farms coming online around the world,
 special system studies are needed.
 One of these studies is Temporary Overvoltage (TOV) study.
 The main purpose of a TOV study is evaluating the capability of the surge
 arresters (SAs) within the substation selected at the preliminary design
 stage of the project.
 To assess the capability of the surge arresters accurately, a detailed
 electromagnetic transient (EMT) model of the project has to be built.
 With the detailed EMT model of a large number of inverters included, the
 run time of the model becomes prohibitive even for a single scenario.
 In this paper, we propose a method to systematically reduce the order of
 the EMT model thus making the model suitable for TOV studies at the substation
 level.
 The reduced order model response is then benchmarked against the response
 of full order model for various TOV scenarios.
 Simulation results show near-to identical agreement between the response
 of the detailed model and the response of reduced order model.
 Additionally, the run time of the proposed reduced model is less than the
 run time of the full order model by a factor of ninety six.

the increased penetration of renewable energy into the grid, special system
 studies are called upon to assess their impact on various aspects of the
 power system.
 One of these aspects is evaluating the adequacy the of surge arresters
 within the substation.
 Surge arrester MCOV and energy handling capability are generally selected
 on an ad hoc manner in early design stage.
 Assessment of the adequacy of the SAs in the substation ensures that SAs
 can ride through the TOV by absorbing an amount of energy that is within
 their energy handling capability and that the TOV level is limited to a
 value determined by applicable standards.
 The IEEE Standard C62.82.1-2010 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "IEEEStd1312.1-19961996"

\end_inset

 defines TOV as â€œan oscillatory phase-to-ground or phase-to-phase overvoltage
 that is at a given location of relatively long duration (seconds, even
 minutes) and that is undamped or only weakly damped; resulting from operation
 of a switching device or fault condition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can occur when the PV inverter is suddenly disconnected from the grid.
 Because inverters act as a constant current source, hence when a circuit
 breaker opens the inverter terminal voltage can cause voltage fluctuations.
 When this occurs, inverters quickly shut down, but there can be a short
 period of time where some inverters can create overvoltage spikes.
 This is a concern for PV system owners and utilities since large voltage
 spikes can damage other equipment that is still connected in the vicinity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Historically, assessment of SAs had been done under specific assumptions
 about the nature of TOV.
 For example, in conventional gas generation and if the neutral of synchronous
 generator is ungrounded, it is known that a single line to ground fault
 can cause the phase to ground voltage to increase by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{3}$
\end_inset

.
 This value can be used along with the surge arrester temporary overvoltage
 withstand capability curve 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "6093926"

\end_inset

 to judge the adequacy of the SA.
 However due to the nature of the technology used in renewable energy resources,
 this might not be true.
 Renewable energy resources are generally inverter based generation.
 These inverter incorporate a large number of switches and are of various
 topologies.
 The temporary overvoltage withstand capability is usable for TOVs lasting
 at least 10 milliseconds and due to the microprocessor controller used
 within these inverters, most TOV events are transient in nature and the
 duration of the TOV events in most cases do not exceed milliseconds.
 Thus, the SA overvoltage withstand capability curve is of no practical
 usefulness in case of TOV events due to inverter based technologies.
 Hence, it is not always possible to assess the capability of a SA using
 the project configuration, grounding scheme and the TOV withstand capability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This necessitates a paradigm shift in performing TOV studies.
 Building the renewable energy project in an EMT type software becomes a
 must to assess the performance of SAs under various scenarios.
 Running such models in EMT software requires small solution time step and
 thus a long simulation run time.
 Moreover, performing many TOV scenarios becomes a daunting task due to
 the long simulation run time.
 Thus, it is of utmost importance to develop a method to reduce the total
 number of switches in the model to reduce the simulation run time.

\begin_layout Standard
Most equivalencing techniques 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 treat the renewable project as one unit, i.e., the whole project starting
 from the main power transformer (MPT) down to the medium voltage collector
 system and the low voltage inverters are replaced by a single electrical
 component that accurately captures the transient performance of the project
 as a whole.
 This is done mainly for grid impact studies and specifically for dynamic
 simulations.
 Popular methods such as the one in

 is suitable only for power flow and dynamic studies not EMT type simulations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we provide a way to reduce the order of the solar PV project
 at the substation level.
 Each feeder of the collector system is reduced on its own to a simple generatio
n resource and an impedance.
 Thus the number of the inverters in the EMT is drastically reduced to the
 number of the feeders in the system.
 It thus possible to study the performance of the SAs in the substation
 since they are installed at the beginning of each of these collector feeders.

 To be able to successfully reduce the order of the model and design the

Methodology

\begin_layout Standard
Just as any electrical source can be represent by its Thevenin's or Norton's
 equivalent 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "watson2003power,bobrow1997elementary"

\end_inset

, the inverters within the solar PV project can be modeled as such depending
 on the technology used within the inverter.
 However, most manufacturers of solar PV inverters use a technology that
 make the inverters act as a current source or a voltage controlled current
 source.
 Due to that, Norton's equivalent model would be most suitable.
 A Norton's equivalent consists of two parts: the Norton's current source
 and the impedance in parallel with it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Basic idea behind the method in this paper is to represent each feeder
 by a pseudo-Norton's equivalent.
 The pseudo-Norton's equivalent will consist of two parts: a pseudo-Norton
 source and an impedance in parallel.
 The pseudo-Norton's source will be responsible for equivalencing the low
 frequency response of the feeder, while the impedance in parallel will
 be equivalencing the high frequency response of the feeder.
 This effectively means that the step response of the pseudo-Norton's source
 should correspond to the low frequency response portion of the overall
 feeder response.
 This also means that the step response of the impedance in parallel should
 correspond to the high frequency response portion of the overall feeder
 response.
 The construction of the pseudo-Norton's source is provided in

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pseudo-Norton's source will consist of an inverter stage with its associated
 controls, a filter as well a transformer.
 Generally speaking, any inverter must contain a filter to shape the output
 waveforms by rejecting the high frequency switching harmonics.
 Inverter manufacturers can use transformerless

LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 technology but this is outside the scope of this paper.
 The validity of the current methodology is yet to be investigated under
 transformerless technology.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To construct the pseudo-Norton's source, the inverter MVA rating must be
 scaled up by a factor equal to the total number of inverters on the feeder.
 Many vendors supply proprietary EMT models of their inverters that has
 the number of inverters or the MVA variable.
 If the user is using a custom EMT model, then the model must have the MVA
 rating or the number of inverters variable.
 The controls of the inverter are to kept the same without any change.
 The values of the inductance and the capacitance of LC filter are also
 to be scaled up by the number of inverters.
 Lastly, the ISU transformer MVA rating is also to be scaled up by a factor
 equal to the number of inverters without changing the per unit impedance
 of the ISA transformer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we used a confidential model supplied by the manufacturer.
 The model has proprietary control algorithms, proprietary switching topology,
 LC filer and an ISU transformer.
 We only scaled the model as described in this section.

\begin_layout Subsection
The Impedance in Parallel
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:The-impedance-in-paralel"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is necessary that the parallel impedance represents the high frequency
 response of the collector system.
 Since it is typical in power flow studies to represent the cable sections
 in the collector system using pi-models, the reader is to be warned against
 such representation in EMT type analysis as this representation is only
 valid at the power frequency.
 The parallel impedance is nothing other than a frequency dependent impedance
 that captures the high frequency response of the cable sections in collector
 feeder.
 Thus the cable sections along the feeder has to be modeled by a suitable
 frequency dependent model.
 The user then has two choices:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Either do a frequency scan on the feeder with all inverters removed from
 the project (transformer has to be open circuited as well as the feeder
 breaker).
 Using that frequency scan, the user can use vector fitting 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gustavsen1999rational,morched1983transmission"

\end_inset

to construct a frequency dependent model.
 Passivity has to be enforced upon the resulting fitting by insuring that
 negative resistance is not a result of the fitting.
 Negative resistance causes instability in the EMT simulations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Keep the feeder intact without performing a vector fitting.
 This means that the cable sections are to be kept in the model but without
 the inverters, LC filters or the ISU transformers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theoretically, both methods should represent the same impedance, i.e., .
 Method 1 above can be done very quickly in PSCAD/EMTDC.
 However, PSCAD/EMTDC does not enforce passivity on the resulting frequency
 dependent model.
 Due to that, the authors used the second method and they will treat the
 first method in a separate publication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The authors also noted that for the equivalencing to produce satisfactory
 results, some cable sections in feeder have to be left out in this equivalencin
g process.
 It turned out that the first cable section has to be removed from this
 frequency dependent impedance.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A total of 72 cases (18 cases per feeder) have been used to benchmark the
 response of the reduced order model against the full order model.
 The cases are grouped into three main categories: feeder energization,
 load rejection and faults.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The feeder energization cases are designed to test the validity of the construct
ion of parallel impedance.
 In these cases all inverters were offline and the feeder was initially
 de-energized.
 At certain time, the feeder breaker is closed and the response of both
 models are compared.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In load rejection cases, the feeder was initially energized and then the
 circuit breaker was abruptly opened.
 Load rejection cases are the most important ones as evident from the tests
 supplied by the manufacturer.
 Load rejection cases should reveal whether scaling and grouping the inverters
 at one point of the feeder is a valid approach.
\end_layout

Finally, fault cases have been performed.
 These are single line to ground , line-line and three phase to ground fault
 on the feeder.

Due to paper length requirement, we will not be reporting on all of the
 results of the benchmark cases but we will report on a selected number
 of scenarios.
 Specifically, scenarios B2, C1, C2, and D1 we will be reporting upon.
 The voltage at the MV bus is measured and compared.
 It should be noted that any switching operations happens around t=0.15 seconds.
 In all the figures below, the waveforms with dashed lines represent the
 reduced order model while waveforms with the continuous lines represent
 the full order model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously for Case A scenarios in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "tab:Benchmark-cases"

\end_inset

, the response of the reduced order model has been identical to the response
 of the full order model.
 This because in the reduced order model, the feeder has been left intact
 as mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:The-impedance-in-paralel"

\end_inset

 and energization occurs with the inverters offline, i.e., the inverter response
 is not part of the overall response and the voltage transients obtained
 are due to the response of the feeders only.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For Case B scenarios, it is noted that the voltage waveforms of the reduced
 order model have more oscillations that the detailed EMT model.
 This is due to the fact that when the inverters are disturbed across the
 feeder, cable sections of the feeder act as a filter that filter out unwanted
 harmonics.
 However, in the reduced order model, only one cable section exists before
 the measuring point.
 Even though, we increased the inverter filter size, we do not get exact
 replica of the voltage waveform of the detailed system model.
 The response of the reduced order model as well as the detailed model is
 shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:b2"

\end_inset

.
 However these higher harmonics don't affect the energy absorbed by the
 SAs since they are fast transients and much below the MCOV of the SAs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For Case C scenarios, apart from the higher frequency harmonics, the response
 of reduced order model of one of the phases seems to not agree very well
 with the response of the full order model in Case C1.
 However, this disparity between the two responses causes a 15 kJ only between
 the calculated energy absorbed by the the arresters between the full and
 reduced order model.
 Given that the energy handling capability of the SAs is 219 kJ, the error
 is less than 7%.
 The response of the reduced order model as well as the detailed model is
 shown in

reference "fig:C1"

 For Case C2, the reduced order model follows the detailed model except

In all scenarios, the run time of the full order model is 8 hours per scenario
 on a workstation having 6 cores at a clock speed of 3.2 GHz and 32 GB of
 RAM.
 For the reduced order model, the simulation run time does not exceed 6
 minutes in any scenario.

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper a systematic way of reducing the order of solar PV farms at
 the substation level has been presented.
 The method is shown to capture accurately the response of the collector
 system under various TOV scenarios that may happen in the substation.
 The method is shown to be much faster that the full order model which makes
 it useful in analyzing a large number of scenarios without the need for
 a highly capable computer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis in this paper is only limited to the SAs in the substation.
 If the feeder have SAs at the ends of the collector system- as usually
 the case- the method here will not be applicable but another method need
 to be used to evaluate those SAs.
 Theoretically speaking the SAs in the substation are the ones that are
 under the most severe duty, and if those arresters pass the evaluation,
 then all other SAs in the project should be safe as well as long as they
 have the same capability.
