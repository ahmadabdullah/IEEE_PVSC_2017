\begin_layout Abstract
With more solar photovoltaic (PV) farms coming online around the world,
 special system studies are needed.
 One of these studies is Transient Overvoltage (TOV) study.
 The main purpose of a TOV study is evaluating the capability of the surge
 arresters selected in the preliminary design stage of the project.
 To assess the capability of the surge arresters accurately, a detailed
 electromagnetic transient (EMT) model of the project has to be built.
 With the detailed EMT model of a large number of inverters included, the
 run time of the model becomes prohibitive even for a single scenario.
 In this paper, we propose a method to systematically reduce the order of
 the EMT model thus making the model suitable for TOV studies at the substation
 level.
 The reduced order model response is then benchmarked against the response
 of full order model for various TOV scenarios.
 Simulation results show identical or near to identical agreement between
 the response of the detailed and the reduced order model.
 Additionally, the run time of the proposed reduced model is less than the
 run time of the full order model by a factor of ninety six.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section will introduce the motivation behind the paper, the statement
 of problem as well as provide some brief literature survey on the problem.
 The final organization of the paper will be provided here as well in the
 last paragraph of this section
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section will provide a quick overview of the method used.
 It will consists of two parts, the first part how to construct the frequency
 dependent model as well as how to represent the inverter in the model.
 This section will basically be a paraphrasing of the transactions paper
 we used to do our model

\begin_layout Section
Application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section will provide a detailed overview on how to apply the methodology
 in PSCAD

\begin_layout Section
System Model 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section will provide an overview of the model used and its various
 components ( I will make sure we are not including any proprietary information)
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Scenarios
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Depending on the length of section 4, I will either have this section as
 a stand alone section or a join it with section 4.
 This section will talk about the various scenarios we did for benchmarking
 and how the cases were set up in PSCAD.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section I will provide the results of the reduced order model and
 the full order model.
 Each case will have a graph that shows the voltage at the terminal of the
 surge arrester in one plot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section will provide conclusions and future work.
